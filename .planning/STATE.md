# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-04)

**Core value:** A developer can go from a bare machine to a working, correctly-ordered install (system prerequisites -> user tools -> AI-agent tooling) entirely through the catalog, with dependency drag-in resolving automatically and no manual ordering knowledge required.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — Package Manager Redirect Policy

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (Package Manager Redirect Policy) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 04
Last activity: 2026-09-05 — Completed 04-04-PLAN.md (doctor per-command labels)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 60%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: Tier gets three top-level catalog views, not an in-screen filter
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: `tier` is orthogonal to `Category`; `requires` remains the sole install-order mechanism, never `tier`
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: `recommends` is a separate, smaller mechanism from `requires` — never auto-installs
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: Oh-My-Zsh's `git`/`docker` plugins are a config-array edit to `.zshrc`, not new `Tool` entries
- [03-02, 2026-09-05]: Shipped as `omz_plugins_policy` (third Policy factory), in-place single-line editor in `installer/omz.py`, not `apply_block`/`strip_block`
- [04-02, 2026-09-05]: volta is a `tier="system"` catalog tool (Linux script + macOS brew, `~/.volta/bin` on both methods); D-07 recorded on the entry — volta install runs ungated npm postinstall scripts
- [04-03, 2026-09-05]: npm/pnpm global install/add/i exec volta install via an argv-conditional PATH shim; _node uses real_pnpm() absolute path so the wrapper cannot intercept catalog installs
- [04-04, 2026-09-05]: doctor copy distinguishes redirect from block via per-command labels; volta install-scripts tradeoff is a Severity.OK note gated on a live pnpm shim

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Six companion PRDs from the same 2026-09-04 batch (`package-manager-policy`, `postinstall-hooks`, `catalog-expansion`, `live-package-management`, `background-maintenance-daemon`, `agent-cli-ergonomics`) are queued for ingestion immediately after this roadmap — expect ROADMAP.md to grow with additional phases soon.
- REQ-dependency-chain-requires' illustrative examples (`oh-my-zsh`, `volta`) name tools not yet in `registry.toml` — they arrive with the (not-yet-ingested) catalog-expansion PRD. Phase 1 demonstrates cross-tier drag-in using the existing `mmdc`->`pnpm` and `java`->`sdkman` `requires` chains instead.

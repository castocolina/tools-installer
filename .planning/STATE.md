# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-04)

**Core value:** A developer can go from a bare machine to a working, correctly-ordered install (system prerequisites -> user tools -> AI-agent tooling) entirely through the catalog, with dependency drag-in resolving automatically and no manual ordering knowledge required.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Catalog Tier Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Catalog Tier Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-04 — ROADMAP created from ingest batch 1/7 (catalog-tiers-and-dependency-chain PRD)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: Tier gets three top-level catalog views, not an in-screen filter
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: `tier` is orthogonal to `Category`; `requires` remains the sole install-order mechanism, never `tier`
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: `recommends` is a separate, smaller mechanism from `requires` — never auto-installs
- [PRD, resolved 2026-09-04]: Oh-My-Zsh's `git`/`docker` plugins are a config-array edit to `.zshrc`, not new `Tool` entries

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Six companion PRDs from the same 2026-09-04 batch (`package-manager-policy`, `postinstall-hooks`, `catalog-expansion`, `live-package-management`, `background-maintenance-daemon`, `agent-cli-ergonomics`) are queued for ingestion immediately after this roadmap — expect ROADMAP.md to grow with additional phases soon.
- REQ-dependency-chain-requires' illustrative examples (`oh-my-zsh`, `volta`) name tools not yet in `registry.toml` — they arrive with the (not-yet-ingested) catalog-expansion PRD. Phase 1 demonstrates cross-tier drag-in using the existing `mmdc`->`pnpm` and `java`->`sdkman` `requires` chains instead.
